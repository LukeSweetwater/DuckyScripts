# DuckyScripts
On this repo, I will be sharing ducky scripts that I myself have developed.

Please note that the files you see on this repo are not plug-and-play as they stand. The files need to be encoded in order to be executable by the USB Rubber Ducky.

I recommend using the following site for encoding the scripts:
https://ducktoolkit.com/encode

Simple copy the text in the .txt file and paste it into the encoder. Download the payload and add it to the storage on the USB Ducky.
